# Homework 1: Code differentiation #


## Requirements:
- Python >= 3.8
- numpy

In this assignment we implemented and evaluated
numerical differentiation for vector-valued and explored forward mode automatic differentiation for multivariate
functions. Included are 2 python scripts:

`python .\numericalDifferentiation.py` \
`python .\automaticDifferentiation.py`
